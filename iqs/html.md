   - em, rem for spacing and font sizes
   - vw, vh for viewport-based sizing
3. ✅ Apply CSS Media Queries
4. ✅ Use Flexbox and Grid for Layouts
5. ✅ Make Images and Media Responsive
   - ``` img, video {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
 ```
6. ✅ Mobile-First Design Approach
7. ✅ Test Across Devices and Viewports
   - Browser DevTools (Chrome, Firefox) with device emulators
